									<h2>The Eve Group</h2>
									<p>In 2014, I joined forces with my sister to setup a company called Eve’s Watch. This was the precursor to The Eve Group which was to become a multifaceted communications agency operating within the horological industry, specialising in women’s watches. In line with an increased interest and investment in this growing sector, it was conceived as a fresh, novel and modern experience to bring together the world of watches and a world of women.</p>
									<p>At the forefront of the women’s watch movement, The Eve Group broke new ground, with its many ‘firsts’, contributing to the very fabric of the industry and a key player in its evolution.</p>
									<p>As co-founder, I conceptualised its many beginnings, and oversaw the operational, commercial and creative agenda to bring the DNA of the business to life.</p>
									<b>The Eve Group brand comprises:</b>
									<ul>
										<li><b>www.eveswatch.com</b> - first to market online magazine dedicated to women’s watches</li>
										<li><b>Eve’s Watch Awards</b> - first ever women’s watch awards</li>
										<li><b>Woman in Watches Network</b> – collective of professional women within the watch arena</li>
										<li><b>Brand Consultancy</b> – expertise provision for luxury and fashion watch brands</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The extent of my versatility in this phase of my career was expansive. The list is endless; from writer to publisher, copywriter to campaign lead, creatives to business setup, reviewer to magazine editor, awards architect to judge, stylist to videographer, client proposals to authoring investment pitches, from hiring to firing, sales to performance reporting, securing partnerships to penning legal agreements and much much more.</p>

									<h2>Eve's Watch Online Magazine</h2>
									<p>Eve’s Watch online publication was the only women’s consumer magazine dedicated to educating women about watches. It provided expert advice on all timepieces from fashion to luxury in the UK and around the world from leading journalists to industry insiders. Whether it is information on which brand to invest in, how a chronograph really works or what watch to buy to match your new shoes, it demystifies the language of watches while positioning them as an integral lifestyle choice.</p>
									<p>This was the staple of the company which then went on to develop the other pillars of the business.</p>

									<p>"Eve’s Watch really stands out in the male-dominated world of watches. Not only is it the only publication in the world that is speaking directly to women, but it does so with a wit and specialist knowledge rarely seen in general women’s interest magazine. It is great to have a publication like this as a resource, just as more and more women are taking an interest in what they wear on their wrist. There’s nothing like Eve’s Watch around and I’m so pleased it exists now."</p>

									<h2>Eve's Watch Awards</h2>
									<p>With the substantial growth in the women’s watch sector more brands are producing seriously beautiful, well-designed watches for women. The Eve’s Watch Awards was the first ever women’s watch awards, born out of a desire to celebrate the world of women’s watches from a position of authority. 

									<p>There were 15 awards covering the luxury and fashion arena ranging from Best Jewellery Watch, Collector’s Choice to Woman of the Year. The main judging panel consists influential, informed and authoritative female watch specialists, journalists, designers and collectors.</p>
									
									<p>The Buyers’ Choice Award was chosen by a collective of the most esteemed watch buyers across leading retailers and independents including John Lewis, Aurum Group Holdings, Signet, DM London, ROX, Jura, Fraser Hart, Beaverbrooks, Sotherby’s, Zeon and Frost of London.</p>
									
									<p>The Popular Choice Award was voted by the public, supported by media partners such as Time Inc. UK (InStyle, Marie Claire, Woman & Home, Living Etc and Country Life) and ESI Media (Evening Standard, ES Magazine and www.standard.co.uk).</p>
									
									<p>The inaugural Awards was held in October 2016 on 24th floor of The Shard in Central London, was an exclusive invitation only event attended by all the great and good of the watch industry. The champagne and canapés reception ceremony hosted by ex-Olympic athlete and Sky News Sports presenter, Jacquie Beltrao, was attended by 200 guests, comprising consumers as well as influencers from all the major brands, retailers and press. </p>
									
									<p>In November 2017, the second Awards sponsored by Urb-it, was an exclusive champagne breakfast at private members club Morton’s, Berkley Square. Invitation-only, the guest list compiled of 75 handpicked invitees to celebrate the winners.</p>
									
									<p>The prestigious winners of the Awards include Patek Philippe, Bulgari, Dior, Rolex, Piaget, Chanel, Richard Mille, Hermès, De Grisogono, Nomos, TAG Heuer, Audemars Piguet, Omega, Urwerk, Moritz Grossmann, Sekford, Gucci, Rado, Michael Kors, Swarovski, Olivia Burton, and Klokers.</p>
									
									<p>Support for the awards was tremendous, through partner promotions and media interest it had the potential reach of 20 million audience</p>
									
									<p>With favourable reportage by major watch trade and specialist media, key consumer magazines and national newspapers including The Telegraph, Evening Standard, CityAM and Hodinkee, the awards were heralded a triumphant success and a welcome fixture in the horological calendar.</p>
